🌾 Crop Recommendation System 🌾
This Crop Recommendation System uses advanced machine learning algorithms to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable crops based on environmental factors such as soil type, climate, and other agricultural parameters. The system employs K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Random Forest models to predict the best crop to grow in specific conditions.

After comparing the performance of each algorithm, the Random Forest model was chosen for its superior accuracy and robustness in handling complex datasets.

✨ Key Features:

🌱 Data-Driven Crop Prediction: Provides crop recommendations based on inputs like soil, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.

🌳 Random Forest Model: Selected for its high performance, accuracy, and ability to handle diverse data inputs.

📊 User-Friendly Interface: Simple interface for farmers to input their agricultural data and receive crop suggestions.

💻 Technologies Used:

🐍 Python

📚 Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

🔢 Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)

📉 Matplotlib (for data visualization)

By using this system, farmers can make informed decisions, boost productivity, and adopt sustainable farming practices 🌾💡.
