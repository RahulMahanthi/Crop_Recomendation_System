# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System 🌾

The **Crop Recommendation System** uses advanced machine learning algorithms to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable crops based on environmental factors such as soil type, climate, and other agricultural parameters. The system employs **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forest** models to predict the best crop to grow in specific conditions. 

After comparing the performance of each algorithm, the **Random Forest** model was chosen for its superior accuracy and robustness in handling complex datasets.

## ✨ Key Features:

- 🌱 **Data-Driven Crop Prediction**: Provides crop recommendations based on inputs like soil type, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
  
- 🌳 **Random Forest Model**: Selected for its high performance, accuracy, and ability to handle diverse data inputs.

- 📊 **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple interface for farmers to input their agricultural data and receive crop suggestions.

## 💻 Technologies Used:

- 🐍 **Python**: Programming language used for the implementation of the system.
  
- 📚 **Scikit-learn**: For building and training the machine learning models (KNN, Decision Trees, and Random Forest).

- 🔢 **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and handling input datasets.

- 📉 **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting results.

## 📋 Requirements:

Before running the system, make sure to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib
